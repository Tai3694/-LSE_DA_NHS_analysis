# Summary - Assignment 2
## How many locations are there in the data set? 
Within in the dataset there are 106 locations for England.

## How many service settings, context types, national categories, and appointment statuses are there?
There are 5 service settings, 3 different context types, 18 national categories and 3 appointment statuses. 

## What are the five locations with the highest number of records?
Out of the 106 locations, the top Five locations with the highest number of records are NHS North West London, NHS North East London, NHS Kent and Medway, NHS Hampshire and Isle of Wight and NHS South East London. It is interesting to see that all of these locations are not in London. Londonâ€™s population makes it the largest in the UK. Therefore, one would think that there would be more records for the whole of London. Instead, we overall that the records are highest in the South of England rather than the North. Potentially this could indicate the need for possible further examination.

## Between what dates were appointments scheduled?
The dates for the appointment range from August 2021 until June 2022. This might be important as this is the time period for when COVID-19 was still a global problem. Therefore, there may be some correlation with the dates and certain services, modes of appointments, duration of appointments and much more.

## Which service setting reported the most appointments in North West London from 1 January to 1 June 2022?  
It is important to indicate that most records are unmapped and can lead to not being able to truly highlight the service setting with most appointment. Besides this we are able to identify that General Practice is the service setting reporting the most appointment in North West London in the specific time frame. 

## Which month had the highest number of appointments?
November 2021 is the month with the highest number of appointments. This could be related to the roll out of COVID vaccinations during that month. 

## What was the total number of records per month?
Able to see that the total number of records per month are on average quite similar. They range roughly from 70,000 to 80,000. We may be able to make a connection between the number of records and the total number of appointments. We know that November 2021 had the highest record for appointments. Yet, the highest total number of records is for March 2022. This is a slight difference.
